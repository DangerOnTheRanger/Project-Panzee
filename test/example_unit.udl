    An example unit, used for describing Project Panzee's UDL.
    Not a whole lot to this one, as it's intentionally bare-bones to only
    provide a very brief overview of what a valid UDL file would look like.

  #-custom_weapon: NonCustomPistol
  #-custom_expendable_weapon: Gernada
  #these all must be defined or the ammo declaration wont work
  # So If I put
 #-SomeVar
 #-ImportantVar: 10
 #This will error out, because 'SomeVar' was not declared, making 'ImportantVar' not able to be declared. (I think)
 #Now you could move 'ImportantVar' above 'SomeVar' and this would work too
